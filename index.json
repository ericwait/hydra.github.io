Light microscopes can now capture data in five dimensions at very high frame rates producing terabytes of data per experiment. Five-dimensional data has three spatial dimensions (x, y, z), multiple channels ($\\lambda$) and time (t). Current tools are prohibitively time consuming and do not efficiently utilize available hardware. The Hydra is a new library providing hardware-accelerated image processing accessible from interpreted languages including MATLAB and Python. Hydra automatically distributes data/computation across system and video RAM allowing hardware-accelerated processing of arbitrarily large images. Hydra also partitions compute tasks optimally across multiple GPUs. Hydra includes a new kernel renormalization reducing boundary effects associated with widely used padding approaches.\n"},{"uri":"https://hydraimageprocessor.com/quick-start/","title":"Quick Start","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Download Download the current files for Windows and Linux here.\nRequirements Windows  Nvidia graphics card (compute capability 3.5 or better) MATLAB 2018 or newer The latest Graphics driver  MacOS Currently unsupported.\nUsing Hydra with MATLAB  Download the MATLAB zip file from the download link above.
